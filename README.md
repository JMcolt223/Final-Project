What we learned...

While creating this project my team and I found out we can do much more with coding than we thought. When using renpy, we were able to explore different aspects of visual novel games. We all went on steam and did some research looking for inspiration for our game. We decided we were going to make this visual novel in a sitcom kind of style, just a lot of silly story lines between a bunch of cool friends. 

One of the main goals we had for this project was that it would have many different choices and story lines and that is exactly what we executed. We worked together to create a fun visual novel with three different endings. 

The main difficulty we faced was navigating all the possibilities of renpy. There is so much to renpy and there was so much we could do for our game. We spent many days looking up Youtube tutorial trying to figure out how code worked in renpy. Overall, it was a fun process for all of us and we learned a lot from our final project.
